# Philosophy
From Android 11 onwards, it is mandatory to use `DocumentsContract` or similar approach to write to shared storage, because of enforcement of Storage Access Framework. Our old and beloved Java File no longer works unless you are writing on private storage.  
Hence there are two different ways to write a file: 1. Use Java File to write to internal storage. 2. Use DocumentsContract to write to shared storage.  
This causes excess code and also DocumentsContract is not very friendly to work with, as it is completely a Uri based approach than the file path based approach we are generally aware of.  

Hence `FileX` was created. FileX tries to address these problems:
1. It is mostly file path based. You as a user of the library do not have to think about Uris. They are handled in background.
2. FileX also wraps around old Java File. You only need to mention one parameter `isTraditional` to use the Java File way, or the DocumentsContract way.
3. Known syntax is used. You will find methods like `mkdirs()`, `delete()`, `canonicalPath` just like old Java File had.

## How paths are interpreted?
If you use the `isTraditional` parameter as below:
```
FileX.new("my/example/path", isTraditional = true)
```
then it is similar to declaring:
```
File("my/example/path")
```
This can be used to access private storage of the app. This also lets you access shared storage on Android 10 and below.  
However, for accessing shared storage on Android 11+, you cannot declare the `isTraditional` parameter as true.  
```
val f = FileX.new("my/path/on/shared/storage")
// ignoring the second parameter defaults to false.
```
You may call `resetRoot()` on the object `f` to open the Documents UI which will allow the user to select a root directory on the shared storage. Once a root directory is chosen by the user, the path mentioned by you will be relative to that root.  
Assume in the above case, the user selects a directory as `[Internal storage]/dir1/dir2`. Then `f` here refers to `[Internal storage]/dir1/dir2/my/path/on/shared/storage`.  
This can also be seen by calling `canonicalPath` on `f`
```
Log.d("Tag", f.canonicalPath)  
//   Output:  /storage/emulated/0/dir1/dir2/my/path/on/shared/storage
```
Once a root is set, you can peacefully use methods like `createNewFile()` to create the document, and other known methods for further operation and new file/document creation.  

# Internal classification (based on `isTraditional`)

![Classification](/doc_assets/FX_classification.png)  

This picture shows how FileX internally classifies itself as two different types based on the `isTraditional` argument. This is internal classification and you as user do not have to worry.  
However, based on this classification, some specific methods and attributes are available to specific types. Example `createFileUsingPicker()` is a method availble to `FileX11` objects, i.e. if `isTraditional` = false. But this method will throw an exception if used on `FileXT` object. These exclusive methods are expanded in a following section.

# Getting started

The library is available on [jitpack.io](https://jitpack.io/#SayantanRC/FileX/)  
1. In top level `build.gradle` file, in `allprojects` section, add jitpack as shown below.
<pre>
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        ...
        <b>maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }</b>
    }
}
</pre>
2. Add dependency.
<pre>
dependencies {
    implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:$kotlin_version"
    implementation 'androidx.core:core-ktx:1.3.2'
    ...
    <b>implementation 'com.github.SayantanRC:FileX:<i>alpha-4</i>'</b>
}
</pre>

Now you can use the library in the project.

Or you can get the AAR files from the [Releases](https://github.com/SayantanRC/FileX/releases) page.  

# Initialization

## Initialize the library
In your `MainActivity` class, in `onCreate()` add the below line. This is only needed once in the entire app.  
<b>This has to be before any `FileX` related operation or object creation is performed!!</b>  
```
FileXInit(this, false)
```
- The first argument is the context of the class. `FileXInit` will internally get the application context from this context.  
- The second argument is a <b>global</b> `isTraditional` attribute. All new FileX objects will take this value if not explicitly mentioned.  

Alternately you can also initialise the `FileXInit()` method from a subclass of the `Application()` class if you have it in your app. 
### Manifest
```
<application
        ...
        android:name=".AppInstance"
        ...
        >
        ...
        
</application>
```
### Application class
<pre>
class AppInstance: Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        ...
        <b>FileXInit(this, false)</b>
    }
}
</pre>

## Create FileX objects to work with
Working with FileX objects is similar to working with Java File objects.
```
val fx = FileX.new("my/path")
```
Here, the object `fx` gets its `isTraditional` parameter from the global parameter defined in `FileXInit()`. If you wish to override it, you may declare as below:
```
val fx = FileX.new("my/path", true)
```
This creates a `FileXT` object i.e. with `isTraditional` = true even though the global value may be false.

# Easy writing to files.
You can easily write to a newly created file without having to deal with input or output streams. Check the below example:
```
// create a blank file
val fx = FileX.new(/my_dir/my_file.txt)
fx.createNewFile(makeDirectories = true)

// start writing to file
fx.startWriting(object : FileX.Writer() {
  override fun writeLines() {
  
    // write a strings without line breaks.
    writeString("a string. ")
    writeString("another string in the same line.")
    
    // write a new line. Similar to writeString() with a line break at the end.
    writeLine("a new line.")
    writeLine("3rd line.")
  }
})
```
